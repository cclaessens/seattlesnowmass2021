## Physics Slam

One Night Only: Thursday July 21 7-8pm.

Watch as four Physicists compete to give the most entertaining explanation of some of the most exciting issues in physics today.  They have only ten minutes each to reveal to you the fundamental secrets of the universe.  You, the audience, will decide which slammer has told you the best story and will go home with the top prize.

This event is open to the general public and targeted at a science-interested audience at the high school level and above.

## Slammer Bios:
![Jorge Torres](jorge_torres.jpg){: style="float: right"}
**Jorge Torres** is a postdoctoral researcher in Wright Lab at Yale University. He received his PhD from The Ohio State University, where he worked for the Askaryan Radio Array Experiment, aimed at observing neutrinos produced in the Universe with ultra-high energies. Jorgeâ€™s current research at Yale focuses on studying neutrinoless double beta decay, an extremely rare process that can help us understand the nature of neutrinos, with the CUORE experiment, and its successor CUPID.  

![Heather Harrington](heather_harrington.png){: style="float: right"}
**Heather Harrington** is a PhD student at the University of Washington. She received her BS from Yale University where she worked on the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab and the AEgIS experiment at CERN. For her PhD, she is working with Alejandro Garcia at the Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics searching for chirality-flipping tensor currents in the weak interaction by using Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) to observe nuclear beta decays with high-accuracy. Her research interests include novel tests of fundamental symmetries, CP violation, detector physics, and instrumentation.
