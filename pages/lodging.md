Seattle is a large city, and all the options you'd expect in a city this size are available. This page gathers a number of lodging options for this meeting.

## Dorm Rooms

Dorm rooms are open for reservation by using this [Link](https://washington.irisregistration.com/Form/4869). To assure a spot, please reserve before June 15!!! We have a huge number blocked off, but at that date we will need to release many of them! If you register for a room after June 24th, you'll be charged a late registration fee of $25 and there may not be rooms availible.

The primary lodging sponsored by the workshop are private dorm rooms on North campus within 0.4 miles from the workshop venue ([7 minute walk](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=7cfe6dc3-30e4-4618-9467-e3830152a7d4&cp=47.65828~-122.308777&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027)). The room layout is a Double room, with private bathroom, desk, and excellent wifi. [Madrona Hall](https://hfs.uw.edu/Campus-Living/Undergraduate-Housing/Madrona-Hall) is recently built and modern construction (as an example of one of the dorm room buildings).

The UW Dorms allow one block per conference - which means while there is some flexability, there isn't a lot for check-in and check-out. Here are how prices work:

Arrival on the day before the workshop, July 16, and departure on the last day of the workshop, July 26, will cost $1095 ($864 + 1*$115.50 + 1*$115.50) for single occupancy ($109.50/night). It is not possible to book outside these dates in the dorms, nor is it possible to not book between July 17 and 25.

## Near Campus Workshp Hotels

The University of Washington negotiated rates for limited rooms at three nearby quality hotels for the workshop attendants. Hotels are all within 0.5 miles from the workshop venue and offer accessible rooms. You have to use direct links below to book the room in order to receive the discount rate.

* [University Inn](https://www.staypineapple.com/university-inn-seattle-wa/uw-exclusive-rates?showbanner=543&promocode=UWR) $167~$208/night. From the menu bar, click ROOMS, choose "(not so) Standard Rooms" and press "Book Now" below the room descriptions. Some of the days might not be available.
* [Watertown](https://reservations.staypineapple.com/?chain=26225&hotel=40206&arrive=07-17-22&depart=07-26-22&group=220717UWCO&configcode=rate&utm_source=uw-conf-mgmt-snowmass&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=group-sales-wt) $189/night.
  * If that block has run out, [there is a UW prefered rate](https://www.staypineapple.com/watertown-hotel-seattle-wa/uw-exclusive-rates?showbanner=543&promocode=UWR) which isn't as good, but is better than the rack rate. From the menu bar, click ROOMS, choose "(not so) Standard Rooms" and press "Book Now" below the room descriptions.
* [Graduate Seattle](https://be.synxis.com/?chain=21643&hotel=76675&filter=UNI) $191~$251/night. Choose  "Always a Husky - UW Alumni Rate."

Three hotels are located at easy walking distance to the rooms where the workshop will take place. According to [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=78efa497-ba9f-4c49-9ee0-07eaf1ef8324&cp=47.658263~-122.314974&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027), the walk from the Water Town to Kane Hall, the building housing the largest meeting room for Snowmass, is 10 minutes. The University Inn is located right next door to the Watertown Inn. The Graduate Seattle is also located a 10 minute walk distance based on [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=573ffe1d-7ffb-4a0b-bad4-de7ed4d1a925&cp=47.659769~-122.314431&lvl=16&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027).

At the time this page was written, rooms were $240/night. -->

## Other Seattle Hotels

THe College Inn, though we do not have a negociated rate, is a pretty special small unique hotel:

* [College Inn](https://www.collegeinnseattle.com/) - Unique/boutique hotel with hostel-like experience (family owned). Located a [5 minute walk](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=befd816b-ca73-4d9f-8318-5a29b4598e4f&cp=47.656136~-122.312218&lvl=18&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027) (about 0.3 mile) closer than the dorms. Many rooms now have private bathrooms, but not all. At the time this page was written, rooms were $190/night.

There are several other hotels near UW campus, and many luxury Hotels in the Downtown Seattle (Typical rate $180~$260/night). They are easily accessible via Uber/Lyft, city bus, light rail or rental car. We advise starting your search near light rail stations - there are two light rail stops on or near campus ([complete stop map](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules?route=1%20Line)). The downtown light rail stops are, with links to _booking.com_:

* [Capitol Hill](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=c33d7755-6ff6-41eb-91e8-f2f0a8cd09d5&cp=47.6188~-122.325786&lvl=16&imgid=4d6d29d9-8a29-47fe-9818-fada5c2777df&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027) Very few hotels are availible in this mostly residential neigbhorhood. AirBnB, however, does have options. This station is a 4-8 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* [Westlake](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=cc8ddbcd-d2bb-4181-bffd-f104693b15b7&cp=47.610676~-122.352731&lvl=14&imgid=d27d92c7-5547-46d8-bf3e-ccd886d95a46&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027). There are a lot of hotels availible in this area. The station is a 12-16 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* University Street. This is very close to the _Westlake_ station, and so hotels accessible by it appear above.

## AirBnB

You might find comfortable rooms or even boat house with economic rates. Make sure your institution will reimburse you for AirBnB. A number of places do not for insurance reasons (for example, some national labs will not).

* North of the university is also possible, and accessible by bike (via the [Burke-Gillman trail](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail)) as well as bus.
* If you are willing to deal with a fairly brutal schedule, you can stay on one of the islands and use the ferry to get back and forth. But be warned that is at least one hour communte each way. The ferries do have good wifi... And the islands are amazing, so this option might be attractive for some.
