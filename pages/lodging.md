title: Lodging for Seattle Snowmass 2022
---

Seattle is a large city, and all the options you'd expect in a city this size are available. This page gathers a number of lodging options for this meeting.

## Dorm Rooms

The primary lodging sponsored by the workshop are private dorm rooms on <a href="https://hfs.uw.edu/Campus-Living/Undergraduate-Housing/Madrona-Hall">north campus</a> within 0.4 miles from the workshop venue (7 minute walk according to [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=7cfe6dc3-30e4-4618-9467-e3830152a7d4&cp=47.65828~-122.308777&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027)). These dorm rooms have a private bathroom, bed, desk, and excellent wifi. The price will be close to $110/night for single, and $68/night for a shared room.

## Near Campus Workshp Hotels

The University of Washington negociated rates at two nearby quality hotels for the workshop attendants. Both hotels are within 0.8 miles from the workshop venue and offer accessible rooms with various features for guests who are seeking these accomodations. You have to use direct links below to book the room in order to receive the UW rate that includes waiving the amenity fee ($19.99).

* <a href="https://www.staypineapple.com/watertown-hotel-seattle-wa/uw-exclusive-rates?showbanner=543&promocode=UWR">Watertown</a> $191~$243/night

* <a href="https://www.staypineapple.com/university-inn-seattle-wa/uw-exclusive-rates?showbanner=543&promocode=UWR">University Inn</a> $166~$208/night

Both hotels are located at easy walking distance to the rooms where the conference will take place. According to [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=78efa497-ba9f-4c49-9ee0-07eaf1ef8324&cp=47.658263~-122.314974&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027), the walk from the Water Town to Kane Hall, the building housing the largest meeting room for Snowmass, is 10 minutes. The University Inn is located right next door to the Watertown Inn.

## Other Seattle Hotels

There are two other hotels located just adjacet to the university. The workshop does not have negociated rates with these hotels.

* Silver Cloud Inn
* DECA

There are several other hotels near UW campus, and many luxury Hotels in the Downtown Seattle (Typical rate $180~$260/night). They are easily accessible via Uber/Lyft, city bus, light rail or rental car. We advise starting your search near light rail stations - there are two light rail stops on or near campus. The downtown light rail stops are:

* link to map, link to hotel.com search centered on station (or similar)
* etc.

## AirBnB

You might find comfortable rooms or even boat house with economic rates. Cautious! Make sure you exercise due diligence by carefully reviewing user comments in order to stay safely through the whole workshop. Also, make sure your institution will reimburse you for AirBnB. A number of places do not for insurance reasons (for example, some national labs will not).

* North of the university is also possible, and accessible by bike (via the [Burke-Gillman trail](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail)) as well as bus.
* If you are willing to deal with a fairly brutal schedule, you can stay on one of the islands and use the ferry to get back and forth. But be warned that is at least one hour each way. The ferries do have good wifi... And the islands are amazing.
