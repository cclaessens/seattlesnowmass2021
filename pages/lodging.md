# Lodging

Seattle is a large city, and all the options you'd expect in a city this size are available. This page gathers a number of lodging options for this meeting:

## Dorm Rooms

The primary lodging sponsored by the workshop are private dorm rooms on <a href="https://hfs.uw.edu/Campus-Living/Undergraduate-Housing/Madrona-Hall">north campus</a> within 0.4 miles from the workshop venue. These dorm rooms have a private bathroom, bed, desk, and excellent wifi. The price will be close to $110/night for single, and $68/night for the share room. We expect most people to stay in these.

## Near Campus Hotels

The University of Washington has designated two quality hotels for the workshop attendants. Both hotels are within 0.8 miles from the workshop venue and offer accessible rooms with various features for guests who are seeking these accomodations. You have to use direct links below to book the room in order to receive the UW rate that includes waiving the amenity fee ($19.99).
