# Public transit to the UW

Seattle is a large city, and all the options you'd expect in a city this size are available.

- By Plane: [Sea-Tac International Airport](https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac) serves Seattle and is about 30 minutes from campus by car (during heavy traffic, this may take up to an hour) or about 45 minutes by light rail.
- By Link light rail: The closest [Link light-rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/route/40_100479) stop is at U District, a 47-minute ride from Sea-Tac International Airport. It’s a 6-minute walk from the light-rail stop to Kane Hall.
- By bus: There are more than 60 [bus routes](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps.aspx) that serve the University District, including many with stops right on campus.

# Private transportation services to the UW
- [Shuttle Express](http://www.shuttleexpress.com/webpages/reservations.html): Shuttle Express offers frequent operation between the airport and any Seattle destination you request.
- [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/rider/cities/seattle-wa), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/seattle/), and metered Taxis: In downtown Seattle, local drivers offer in-city transportation. All rides can be scheduled using smartphone apps. Taxi services include [STITA](https://www.stitataxi.com/), [Yellow Cab](https://seattleyellowcab.com/), and [Orange Cab](http://orangecab.net/).

# Parking on campus
If you drive, we recommend getting to campus at least 30 minutes before your scheduled visit to allow time to park and find your way to your destination. [When you arrive, visit one of the gatehouses to purchase a permit](https://transportation.uw.edu/park). The gatehouse attendant will direct you to a parking lot.

# Seattle weather

Seattle summers really shine: June through August, the average temp is 71 degrees, with maybe a week or two of over-80 weather (usually in July). The moderate heat and dry, blue-sky days make the area a paradise for hikers, campers, kayakers, cyclists and other lovers of the outdoors.
