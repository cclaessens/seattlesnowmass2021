# Outreach activities

Seattle has a large network of local public libraries and after-school programs which host many events. 
The outreach committee of the LOC is planning to host up several events at these venues. 
Events will be organised during the summer with the intent of raising awareness of the Snowmass proceedings. 
Physicists from the workshop will be invited to join these events to engage directly with the public in small groups.

If you are interested in developing some outrach activities or if you would like to participate to these events as a science communicator, please get in touch with us!
