Below you'll find information on the layout of the buildings on campus, a brief description of the rooms, and some information about where to find small meeting rooms around campus.

## Campus

The meeting will take place on the University of Washington's Seattle campus. Located just north of downtown Seattle. Here are some quick resources for getting around:

## The Meeting Rooms

Below is a list of all the meeting rooms along with a small amount of information about each. The _Session Chair Must Supply_ column indicates what the session chair must bring to operate the sound system in the room and connect to zoom. For most of our larger rooms everything is supplied. In the very small rooms, which are designed to be discussion rooms, nothing is required.

| Meeting Room | Seats |  Sound & Zoom Config | Session Chair Must Supply |
