Below you'll find information on the layout of the buildings on campus, a brief description of the rooms, and some information about where to find small meeting rooms around campus.

## Campus

The meeting will take place on the University of Washington's Seattle campus. Located just north of downtown Seattle. Here are some quick resources for getting around:

## The Meeting Rooms

Below is a list of all the meeting rooms along with a small amount of information about each. The _Session Chair Must Supply_ column indicates what the session chair must bring to operate the sound system in the room and connect to zoom. For most of our larger rooms everything is supplied. In the very small rooms, which are designed to be discussion rooms, nothing is required.

## Small Meeting Rooms

We have a range of small un-programmed meeting spaces around the campus. Many are in the physics department. There are a collection that are also around the campus, run by the university, and available on a first-come-first-serve basis. It is summer, and a number of cafe locations are closed, though the tables and chairs are still accessible - these make for great working spaces for small groups. We've listed what we've got, along with where you can either sign them out or look up their availability below.

| Name & Location | Sign-up | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Physics Building B205, [PAB](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/pab) | Ask at Help Desk | Single large table, seats about 10, or 15 if crowded |

## Offices

We have a very limited supply of offices available. These are suitable for 1, 2, or 3 people working together in close collaboration and have a door you can close for privacy. These are other people's offices who have lent them to us - please be respectful of the space!

To use one, drop by the help desk and sign one out. Please return the keys promptly!
