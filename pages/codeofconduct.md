# Code of Conduct

Snowmass is a DPF sponsored activity, therefore we embrace the [DPF Core Principles and Community Guidelines (CP&CG)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OD8khECoDKni_yMsSdkzgdYvUUXl4O2pQCbCwGURILI/edit) as a code of conduct for our event.

We encourage everyone to read the CP&CG.  It has 3 parts:
-Core principles: what our community values most
-Community guidelines: expectations of behavior 
-Accountability: procedures with an emphasis on early intervention for the wellbeing of all community members

The CP&CG is everyoneâ€™s responsibility:
-You can invoke the CP&CG to ensure constructive participation by everyone
-You can discuss possible violations with your conveners or meeting hosts
-You can discuss directly with the subset of the Ethics Task Force which forms [the CP&CG response team](https://snowmass21.org/cpcg/start).  

For a deep dive into the CP&CG, pleaes see [this recording](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/23818/contributions/197448/attachments/134659/167078/go) of the CP&CG training for Snowmass conveners ([slides](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/23818/contributions/197448/attachments/134659/166732/cpcgtraning.pdf)).
