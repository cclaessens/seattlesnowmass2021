## Travel Awards

We have some money set aside for travel awards. We will give priority to:

* Women and minorities
* Early Career members of our community
* People involved in the Snowmass Process, or presenting a poster.

To submit an application please fill out this google form (coming shortly). Please have this submitted by May 25th to assure timely notification.

If you have questions, [please let us know!](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu).
