## Child Care

We are working with the [UW Youth Protection](https://www.washington.edu/youth/) to provide centralized access to child care facilities based on demand. Please complete the [Survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69), or Contact Us via [email](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu)/[#seattle-snowmass-childcare](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/archives/C03CMLBEJ0K)] with your needs.

## On-site child care

The drop-in rate of shared nanny service is $5/hr per kid. The venue is Mary Gates Hall R206, a 5 min walk from the workshop venue. In addition to shared nannies, you can also hire your own nannies/babysitters and use the facility without additional cost. There are three kids groups for subscriptions:
- Lepton (under 2): 1 nanny to 4 kids. 
- Quark (between 2 and 5): 1 nanny to 4 kids. No requirement of potty training.
- Boson (between 5 and 12): 1 nanny to 8 kids.

The nannies and baby-sitters can be hired from sites below. Folks can post an ad for available opportunities.
