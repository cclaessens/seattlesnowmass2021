## Child Care

We are working on providing centralized access to child care facilities based on demand. Please [Contact Us](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu) with your needs.

In the meantime, some potential options are
- [University District YMCA](https://www.seattleymca.org/locations/university-family-ymca) for camps/care options
- local daycares such as [KinderCare](https://www.kindercare.com/our-centers/seattle/wa/301786), [Bright Horizons](https://child-care-preschool.brighthorizons.com/wa/seattle/uvillage)
- hiring a shared nanny with other attendees

To aid with this last option, we have created a [Slack channel on the Snowmass2021 workspace](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/archives/C03CMLBEJ0K) for childcare. 

Additional information regarding UW-area childcare options can be found [here](https://faculty.uwmedicine.org/school-and-child-care/)
