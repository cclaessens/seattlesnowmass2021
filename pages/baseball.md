## Travel

Baseball night's in Seattle are packed! It is best not to drive, by far the best is public transportation. There are also lots and lots of bars and restaurants down in the area and they will be packed with fans.

To get to and from the UW campus, take any light rail south-bound and disembark at the Stadium Station. It is a 10 minute walk from there.
