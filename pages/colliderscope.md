# ColliderScope

There will be a [Colliderscope](https://colliderscope.web.cern.ch/) concert on Saturday, July 23 at the [Blue Moon Tavern](https://www.thebluemoonseattle.com/), Seattle's Most Infamous Dive Bar, from 8 to 11:30 pm.

Members of the public and workshop attendees over 21 years old are encouraged to come listen to, dance along with, and marvel at the DJ stylings and oscilliscope wonderment of Larry Lee and the gameboy + violin creativity of Nikola Whallon.
