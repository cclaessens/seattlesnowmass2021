The University of Washington's Physics department is involved in many research programs and is home to a number of experiments. We are very happy that our faculty, post-docs, and students have expressed interest in leading small tours of some of the labs.

A first-come-first-serve sign up sheet for all the available tours will be put up closer to the workshop itself. Please check back here!
