The University of Washington's Physics department is involved in many research programs and is home to a number of experiments. We are very happy that our faculty, post-docs, and students have expressed interest in leading small tours of some of the labs.

Tours of the Center for Experimental Nuclear Physcis and Astrophysics (<a href="https://www.npl.washington.edu/">CENPA</a>), featuring the Axion Dark Matter Experiment, will be available on Thursday and Friday.
