Everyone following Snowmass is likely aware of the [pause in the process](https://snowmass21.org/announcements). Part of this, of course, is rescheduling the in-person meeting of the community in the summer.

We've rescheduled the summer study to be July 17-27, 2022. A year and a week later than originally planned! We are currently expecting the USA to be fully vaccinated by this time and thus this is in person. While planning is far from complete, we will follow all university and state safety guidelines. We also understand not everyone will be able to make it to Seattle and will do our best to provide video connections.

The entire LOC is looking forward to seeing you here in Seattle, in person if possible, otherwise on video!
