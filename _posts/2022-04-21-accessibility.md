summary: Accessibility Survey and Page Update
---

We've made a major update to our [accessibility page](/accessibility), thanks to the [Accessibility members of the LOC](http://localhost:4001/about/loc/)! Most important - if you are planning on coming there is a non-anonymous survey there we'd love you to fill out in you have any accessibility needs. The sooner this is filled out the better we can do our planning.
