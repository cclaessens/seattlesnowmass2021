summary: Attendance Survey Results - We are looking forward to seeing everyone on July 17th!

We had an amazing response from an Attendance Survey. [The full results can be found here](https://gordonwatts.github.io/snowmass-attendance) - 730 of you responded and left us opinions and comments. That link is our best effort at aggregating that information. The landing page has most of the high level conclusions.

The big conclusion is we are going to plan to hold this in person! The LOC is now working hard on preparations, including COVID procedures to keep everyone as safe as possible.  We are looking forward to seeing everyone this summer!
