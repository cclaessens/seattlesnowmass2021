The detailed workshop schedule is starting to come together! This is a huge amount of work by the program committee and other members of the community - so thanks for that!

If you want to see a block diagram of the schedule you can find it on the site, under _Program_, _Block Schedule_, or directly at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6idO-hcOFMDaW5hsgWv6UNlcIF3plSXjgL8bTIQYfU). As you might guess from the link, this points to a google spreadsheet which we are keeping up to date. At some point `indico` will become the official schedule. But until then, feel free to use this!
